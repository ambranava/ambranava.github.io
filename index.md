## About
I am a Bachelor’s graduate in Psychology with a focus on research methods and data analysis. 
My academic interests lie in quantitative and qualitative research, with particular attention to study design, data collection, and the interpretation of empirical results.

During my studies, I contributed to research activities involving surveys, interviews, and statistical analysis, and developed experience in managing data across different stages of the research process. 
I am familiar with both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, including survey research, interview-based studies, and thematic analysis.

I have worked with tools such as Python, Stata, R, SPSS, and Excel to support data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and reporting. 
I am currently seeking a Research Assistant position in an academic setting, where I can contribute to ongoing research projects and further develop my methodological skills.
