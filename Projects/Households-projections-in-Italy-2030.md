# Households projections in Italy (2030)  
### Lombardy and Sardinia

## Overview
This project analyses the expected evolution of **household structures** in Italy by 2030, focusing on a comparative perspective between **Lombardy** and **Sardinia**.  
Using official demographic statistics, the research explores how ageing, fertility trends and regional differences are likely to reshape household composition.

The project adopts a **quantitative, secondary-data-based approach**, with particular attention to implications for social and territorial planning.

---

## Research objectives
- Describe current household structures in the two regions  
- Project demographic and household trends up to 2030  
- Compare regional patterns and trajectories  
- Identify potential implications for housing, welfare and social services  

---

## Data sources
- Official demographic statistics (ISTAT)  
- Aggregated regional-level data  
- Secondary data only  

> No personal or sensitive data were collected or processed.

## Methodology
- Descriptive demographic analysis  
- Scenario-based projections  
- Comparative regional approach  

Methodological assumptions and projection schemes are documented in the appendix:

[Appendix A - Methodology](Appendices/Households-projections-in-Italy-2030/Appendix-a-methodology.md) 

---

## Key findings
- Increase in single-person households, particularly among older adults  
- Strong impact of population ageing on household composition  
- Persistent regional differences between Lombardy and Sardinia  
- Potential pressure on housing systems and welfare services

## Outputs
- Demographic projections (tables and charts)  
- Comparative analysis between regions  
- Methodological documentation  

Outputs are documented in the appendix:

## Research scope and limitations
- Regional focus limited to Lombardy and Sardinia  
- Projections based on available secondary data  
- Results should be interpreted as scenario-based estimates
