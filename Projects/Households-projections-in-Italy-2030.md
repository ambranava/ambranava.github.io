# Households projections in Italy (2030)  
### Lombardy and Sardinia

## Overview
This project examines demographic change and household structure in two Italian regions, Lombardy and Sardinia, with a specific focus on:
- projected changes in household composition
- population age structure and ageing dynamics
- regional similarities and differences in demographic trajectories

The study combines quantitative projections with an integrated analytical interpretation to explore how population ageing interacts with family patterns at the regional level.

---

## Research objectives 
The project aims to:
- analyse projected changes in household composition up to 2030 
- examine population age structure as a central demographic dimension  
- interpret household dynamics in relation to demographic ageing
- compare regional trends through analytical (non-graphical) comparison

---

## Data sources
- Official demographic statistics (ISTAT)  
- Aggregated regional-level data  
- Secondary data only  

> No personal or sensitive data were collected or processed.

---

## Methodology
- Descriptive demographic analysis  
- Scenario-based projections  
- Comparative regional approach

The analysis is based on:
- regional demographic data
- projections of household structures
- population age pyramids by region

Quantitative outputs are presented separately for each region, while comparative insights are developed through integrated interpretation.

Methodological assumptions and projection schemes are documented in the appendix:

## Key outputs
- Projections of household composition by typology 
- Population age pyramids for Lombardy and Sardinia 
- Integrated interpretation of age structure and family dynamics

Detailed quantitative results and figures are available in Appendix B, while analytical conclusions are presented in Appendix C.

**[Appendix C - Interpretation and conclusions](Appendices/Households-projections-in-Italy-2030/Appendix-c-interpretation-and-conclusions.md)**

> Note: figures and tables are presented in Italian, as the original research was conducted within an Italian academic context.
