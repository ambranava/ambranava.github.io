### Psychosocial Research Project – Volunteer-Based Emotional Support Service

**Context.**  
The study was commissioned by a volunteer-based emotional support service and conducted by the university in response to an applied research need.

**Research aim.**  
Building on a previous study, the project aimed to conduct psychosocial research to inform the development of a communication strategy for the service. 
Specifically, the research focused on identifying the values, image traits, and symbolic constructs associated with the service, in order to provide evidence-based guidance for future outreach and engagement efforts.

**My role.**  
I contributed to the project through several research-related activities, including:

- Designing and administering telephonic interviews  
- Planning and facilitating focus group activities  
- Observing focus group sessions and taking detailed field notes  
- Conducting qualitative data analysis  
- Supporting the drafting of research reports and presentations  
- Presenting findings to project stakeholders

**Process / Objectives.**  
The project focused on two main objectives:

1. **Identifying key values and characteristics of the service**  
   - Determining central traits, common topics, and guiding principles  
   - Exploring specific features of the service and its volunteers  
   - Comparing the service with similar nationwide support programs to highlight distinguishing aspects

2. **Generating evidence-based guidance for future communication**  
   - Identifying key meanings, experiences, and themes to emphasize  
   - Highlighting aspects of the service that could be effectively communicated externally  
   - Considering appropriate modes and channels for outreach based on research findings

**Methodology.**  
To address the research objectives, a qualitative study was conducted, including:

- Fifteen in-depth telephone interviews using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) approach  
- Two ideation focus groups conducted in separate locations

To facilitate creative and reflective responses, the following qualitative techniques were applied during the focus groups:

- Collage and storytelling exercises  
- Projective techniques, metaphors, and associative methods  
- Personifications and scenario-based activities

**Participants.**  
The study involved a total of 27 volunteers from the service, including:

- Fifteen participants in the in-depth telephone interviews  
- Twelve participants in the ideation focus groups

**Outputs / Status.**  
The study produced findings to guide future communication strategies for the volunteer-based emotional support service. Key outcomes included:

- **Recruitment messaging for new volunteers:**  
  The research highlighted the importance of training, showing that volunteers acquire skills that are valuable both during service activities and in their broader personal and professional development.

- **Communication channels:**  
  Insights suggested several potential approaches for reaching target audiences, including social media platforms, broadcast media, and collaborations with educational and municipal institutions.

- **Service identity and volunteer experience:**  
  The study identified core aspects of the service’s identity and the perceived benefits for volunteers, emphasizing personal growth, ethical skill development, and the supportive role of the service in assisting individuals in need.

The findings were summarized in research reports and presentations, which served as evidence-based guidance for planning future outreach and volunteer recruitment initiatives.

**Key takeaways.**  
The project provided the opportunity to develop practical research skills and experience working in a professional research context. Key outcomes included:

- Gaining direct experience in applied research  
- Learning and applying qualitative research techniques  
- Conducting ideation focus groups  
- Collaborating with external stakeholders  
- Managing project timelines and coordinating team activities  
- Applying theoretical knowledge in practice
