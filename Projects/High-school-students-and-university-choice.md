### High school students and university choice

**Context.**  
This applied research project was conducted by a student group as part of a university course. The aim was to explore how high school students make decisions regarding university enrollment, with a particular focus on the perceived image of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. 

The study combined qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire to gather comprehensive insights.

**My role.**  
I was actively involved in all stages of the project, including designing the qualitative and quantitative instruments, conducting interviews, analyzing data, and synthesizing results for reporting and presentation.

**Process / Objectives.**  
The research investigated three main areas:
- orientation (school-provided vs. self-directed research)
- choice process (factors influencing university and faculty selection)
- image of Università Cattolica (knowledge, opinions, and communication channels)

The qualitative phase informed the questionnaire design, while the quantitative phase allowed structured data collection and preliminary trend analysis.

**Methodology.**  

1. **Qualitative Phase**
   Purpose: to identify relevant themes, gaps, and variables for the questionnaire.

   Design:
   - Semi-structured interviews (~30 questions) with 5 high school students.
   - Interviews included three macro areas:
     1. orientation: how students received guidance (school vs. personal research)
     2. choice Process: Factors influencing university/faculty selection, timing, and external influences (parents, peers, teachers)
     3. university image: Knowledge, opinions, and awareness of Università Cattolica.
        
   Procedure:
     1. each group member conducted one interview
     2. interviews were analyzed by other group members to ensure objectivity
     3. a coding table was used to extract insights:
        - Column 1: main themes / labels
        - Column 2: content from interviews
        - Column 3: relevant verbatim.
       
    Outcome:
     - Identification of unanticipated factors (e.g., public fairs) that informed the questionnaire.
     - Structured foundation for quantitative data collection.

3. **Quantitative Phase**  
   Purpose: to systematically measure trends and perceptions identified in the qualitative phase.

   Design:
   - Structured questionnaire (~15 minutes) administered to 10 students (results scaled for analysis to simulate N=100).
   - Three macro areas mirrored the qualitative study: orientation, choice process, and university image.
   - Standardized Likert scales used for evaluative items.
   - Filter questions differentiated between students who chose university paths vs. workforce paths.
       
   Procedure:
     1. each group member conducted one interview
     2. interviews were analyzed by other group members to ensure objectivity
     3. a coding table was used to extract insights:
        - Column 1: main themes / labels
        - Column 2: content from interviews
        - Column 3: relevant verbatim.
       
    Outcome:
     - Identification of unanticipated factors (e.g., public fairs) that informed the questionnaire.
     - Structured foundation for quantitative data collection.

    Questionnaire Structure:
      1. Demographics: Age, gender, school type.
      2. Orientation:
         - Mode of information received (school vs. personal research)
         - Evaluation of usefulness
      3. Choice Process:
         - University/faculty selection
         - Influences (parents, peers, teachers)
         - Timing of decision-making
      4. University Image:
         - Opinions and knowledge
         - Perceived services, costs, logistics
         - Communication effectiveness
      5. Improvement suggestions: Items derived from qualitative insights
    
     Analysis:
     - Descriptive statistics for all items.
     - Trends comparison between orientation modes.
     - Identification of key gaps in knowledge and perceptions.
       
3. **Integration of Qualitative and Quantitative Findings**  
   - Qualitative insights informed questionnaire design and item selection.  
   - Quantitative results provided trend validation and structured comparisons.  
   - Together, both phases allowed a comprehensive understanding of student decision-making and perceptions.

- Appendix B: - [Questionnaire guide](Appendices/High-school-students-and-university-choice/Questionnaire-guide.md) 

**Participants.**  
Students in the 5th year of high schools in Lombardy (external validity is limited to this population).

**Outputs.**  
- Personal research (web) is the most used orientation method, while school-organized activities are valued for direct interaction with university representatives.
- Many students had not finalized their university choice by May.
- Università Cattolica is perceived positively overall, though costs are a noted limitation.
- Qualitative interviews provided critical insights for refining the quantitative survey, highlighting previously unconsidered factors.

**Key takeaways.**  
The project provided the opportunity to develop practical research skills and experience working in a professional research context. Key outcomes included:

- Gaining direct experience in applied research  
- Learning and applying qualitative research techniques  
- Conducting interviews and administering questionnaires
