### High school students and university choice

**Context.**  
This applied research project was conducted by a student group as part of a university course. The aim was to explore how high school students make decisions regarding university enrollment, with a particular focus on the perceived image of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. 

The study combined qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire to gather comprehensive insights.

**My role.**  
I was actively involved in all stages of the project, including designing the qualitative and quantitative instruments, conducting interviews, analyzing data, and synthesizing results for reporting and presentation.

**Process / Objectives.**  
The research investigated three main areas:
- orientation (school-provided vs. self-directed research)
- choice process (factors influencing university and faculty selection)
- image of Università Cattolica (knowledge, opinions, and communication channels)

The qualitative phase informed the questionnaire design, while the quantitative phase allowed structured data collection and preliminary trend analysis.

**Methodology.**  


Detailed data collection instruments are provided in the appendices:
- Appendix A: - [Interviews guide](Appendices/Psychosocial-research/Interviews-guide.md)  
- Appendix B: - [Focus groups guide](Appendices/Psychosocial-research/Focus-groups-guide.md) 

**Participants.**  
Students in the 5th year of high schools in Lombardy (external validity is limited to this population).

**Outputs.**  
- Personal research (web) is the most used orientation method, while school-organized activities are valued for direct interaction with university representatives.
- Many students had not finalized their university choice by May.
- Università Cattolica is perceived positively overall, though costs are a noted limitation.
- Qualitative interviews provided critical insights for refining the quantitative survey, highlighting previously unconsidered factors.

**Key takeaways.**  
The project provided the opportunity to develop practical research skills and experience working in a professional research context. Key outcomes included:

- Gaining direct experience in applied research  
- Learning and applying qualitative research techniques  
- Conducting interviews and administering questionnaires
