## Data Collection – Focus groups guide

### Research Context

Two ideation-focused group discussions were conducted with Telefono Amico Italia (TAI) volunteers as part of a psychosocial qualitative research project aimed at supporting the development of a future communication campaign.

The focus groups were designed to explore shared meanings, values, emotional representations, and symbolic constructions of TAI, while also fostering creative ideation for communication purposes.

### Focus Group Structure

The interview guide was structured into three main sections:

**1. Introduction and group setting**
Participants were informed about:
- the research objectives and applied nature of the project
- confidentiality and data protection procedures
- the use of audio recording for research purposes

Ground rules were established to encourage open participation, mutual respect, and creative freedom.
The group setting emphasized experiential and non-judgmental sharing.

**2. Warm-up: volunteering experience and emotional engagement**

This initial phase aimed to activate participants’ personal experience and emotional connection with TAI.

Discussion prompts focused on:
- pathways into volunteering
- motivations for joining and remaining in TAI
- emotional and experiential aspects of volunteering
- perceived positive and critical elements of the experience
- meaning of being a TAI volunteer

This phase served as a transition from individual experience to collective reflection.

**3. Experiential and projective activities**
To facilitate less rationalized and more symbolic expression, several creative techniques were employed.

These included:
- Collage: visual representation of emotions and lived experience related to TAI
- Image-based storytelling: collective discussion of chosen images
- Projective and metaphor-based exercises: associations, symbols, and shared meanings

Participants were invited to reflect on similarities and differences in representations and emotions emerging within the group.

**4. Image and Values of Telefono Amico Italia**
This phase focused on the collective construction of TAI’s identity.

Activities included:
- associations and personifications (TAI as a person, animal, color, etc.)
- identification of distinctive traits, strengths, and perceived limitations
- exploration of shared values and symbolic attributes

The aim was to surface implicit identity dimensions and value-based representations.

**5. Collective meaning-making and creative ideation**
To support applied outcomes, participants engaged in structured ideation activities.

Key exercises included:
- “Yes, and…” chain exercise to co-construct meanings collaboratively
- Bullseye (Target) exercise to distinguish core vs. peripheral values
- discussion of elements that differentiate TAI from other helpline organizations

This phase translated experiential insights into communicable themes.

**6. Synthesis and discussion**
The focus group concluded with a collective reflection on:
- key strengths and values of TAI
- identity elements relevant for external communication
- potential risks or misrepresentations to avoid

Moderation focused on maintaining attention to value-laden content and shared meanings.

### Methodological notes
- Focus groups were moderated using a semi-structured guide.
- Creative and projective techniques were intentionally used to support ideation and symbolic expression.
- Participants were volunteers of TAI; no personal identifiers were collected or reported.

> Note: The original focus group guide was developed in Italian, as the research was conducted in an Italian contest with Italian volunteers.
