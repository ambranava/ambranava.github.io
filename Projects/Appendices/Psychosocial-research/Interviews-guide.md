## Data collection – In-depth interviews

Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with TAI volunteers.

The interview guide was designed to explore:
- volunteers’ personal experience and motivations
- perceived identity and core values of TAI
- symbolic and emotional representations of the association
- insights for future communication and fundraising campaigns

The guide combined:
- experiential questions
- evaluative questions
- projective and metaphor-based techniques
- creative prompts aimed at generating communication ideas

### Interview guide structure

The interview guide was structured into three main sections:

**1. Volunteering experience**
- entry into volunteering and motivation
- role and activities within TAI
- emotional experience of volunteering
- perceived impact on personal life
- strengths and critical aspects of the service

**2. Image and values of TAI**
- symbolic representations (images, metaphors, personifications)
- perceived core and peripheral values (target/bullseye exercise)
- differentiation from other helpline organizations
- key traits defining TAI’s identity

**3. Insights for future communication**
- key themes and messages for fundraising and volunteer recruitment
- visual and symbolic elements for communication materials
- evaluation of previous communication campaigns
- creative suggestions (slogans, flyer content)

### Methodological notes
- Interviews were conducted via telephone.
- The guide was semi-structured to allow flexibility and depth.
- Projective and creative techniques were integrated to reduce rationalization and facilitate symbolic expression.

> Note: the original interview guide was developed in Italian, as the research was conducted in an Italian contest with Italian volunteers.
