# Appendix B - Quantitative outputs (regional results)

## Purpose of the appendix
This appendix presents the main quantitative outputs of the demographic projections for household structures up to 2030.

Results are shown separately for each region (Lombardy and Sardinia).
A comparative interpretation across regions is provided exclusively in the Conclusions (Appendix C), where trends and structural differences are discussed jointly.

## Organization of results
Quantitative outputs are organized:
- by region
- by households dimension

## Lombardy - Household structure projections
### Figure B1 - Household composition by typology (%), Lombardy
**Type**: Line chart (percentages).
**Time horizon**: Projection to 2030.

### Figure B2 - Total number of households (absolute values), Lombardy
**Type**: Line chart (absolute values).
**Time horizon**: Projection to 2030.
Projected total number of households in Lombardy. Absolute values provide scale context for percentage-based trends.

## Sardinia - Household structure projections
### Figure B3 - Household composition by typology (%), Sardinia
**Type**: Line chart (percentages).
**Time horizon**: Projection to 2030.
Projected distribution of main household typologies in Sardinia up to 2030.

### Figure B4 - Total number of households (absolute values), Sardinia
**Type**: Line chart (absolute values).
**Time horizon**: Projection to 2030.
Projected total number of households in Sardinia. Absolute values provide scale context for percentage-based trends.

## Lombardy - Population age structure
### Figure B5 - Population age pyramid (projection to 2030)
Projected population age structure by age and sex. The age pyramid represents a key analytical dimension of the study, informing changes in household formation.

## Sardinia - Population age structure
### Figure B6 - Population age pyramid (projection to 2030)
Projected population age structure by age and sex. The pyramid highlights structural demographic patterns relevant to the interpretation of household dynamics.
