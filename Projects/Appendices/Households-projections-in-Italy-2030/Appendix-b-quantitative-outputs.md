# Appendix B – Quantitative outputs (regional results)

## Purpose of the appendix
This appendix presents the main quantitative outputs of the demographic projections for household structures up to 2030.

Results are shown separately for each region (Lombardy and Sardinia).
A comparative interpretation across regions is provided exclusively in the Conclusions (Appendix C), where trends and structural differences are discussed jointly.

## Organization of results
Quantitative outputs are organized:
- by region
- by households dimension
