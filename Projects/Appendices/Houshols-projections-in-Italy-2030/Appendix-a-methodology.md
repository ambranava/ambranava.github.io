# Appendix A – Methodology

## Research Objective
The objective of this study was to project household structures and family composition in 2030 for two Italian regions with different demographic dynamics:
- Lombardy
- Sardinia

The analysis aimed to identify:
- expected changes in household size and typology
- regional differences in family structures
- demographic trends relevant for social and policy planning

---

## Study design
The project followed a quantitative demographic analysis based on:
- secondary data sources
- descriptive statistical analysis
- demographic projection techniques

The study was conducted as an academic research project, with a focus on methodological rigor and transparency rather than predictive certainty.

---

## Data sources
The analysis relied exclusively on official demographic statistics, including:
- population and household data from national statistical sources (ISTAT)
- historical time series on:
  - household composition
  - fertility and aging indicators
  - marital status and living arrangements

All data referred to regional-level populations, ensuring internal consistency across indicators.

## Variables and indicators
Key variables included:
- **Household size**
  - single-person households
  - two-person households
  - households with three or more members
- **Household typology**
  - couples with children
  - couples without children
  - single-parent households
  - individuals living alone
- **Demographic structure**
  - age distribution
  - population aging trends

These indicators were selected to capture both structural and social dimensions of family change.

## Analytical approach
The methodological process followed four main steps:
- **Exploratory analysis**: historical trends in household composition were analyzed separately for Lombardy and Sardinia
- **Trend extrapolation**: observed demographic patterns were projected forward to 2030 using linear and proportional assumptions
- **Comparative regional analysis**: results were compared across the two regions to highlight structural differences and divergent trajectories
- **Interpretative synthesis**: quantitative outputs were interpreted in light of known demographic and socio-cultural dynamics

The analysis focused on scenario-based projections, not on precise population forecasting.
