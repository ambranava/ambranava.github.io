# Appendix A – Qualitative research design

## A.1 Research rationale
The qualitative phase was designed to explore how upper secondary school students approach
the transition from school to university, focusing on orientation processes, decision-making pathways,
and perceptions of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (hypothesized client).

The interview structure was organized around three main analytical dimensions.

The first dimension focused on **orientation experiences**.
Participants were asked about their upper secondary school background
(type of school, field of study, and geographical location),
as well as the orientation activities provided by their school,
including open days, information sessions, and testimonies by university students or faculty.
The interviews explored the type of information received about the university system
(faculties, universities, access requirements) and participants’ evaluation of the usefulness
of school-based orientation.
Personal orientation activities conducted independently by students were also investigated.

The second dimension addressed the **university choice process**.
Participants were asked about their choice of faculty and university,
distinguishing between secure, tentative, and undecided choices,
and the motivations underlying each condition.
Key decision factors were explored, including prestige, availability of the chosen faculty,
teaching staff, access modalities, costs, logistics, and perceived professional outcomes.
The role of external influences (parents, peers, teachers) and the timing of the decision-making
process were also examined.

The third dimension focused on the **image of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore**.
Interviews explored students’ awareness of the university, communication and promotional channels
(open days, web presence, public events, school-based orientation),
and perceived clarity of information regarding courses, services, costs, and access requirements.
Perceptions of service quality, logistics, financial aspects, and career prospects were investigated,
along with opinions derived from indirect experiences.
Finally, participants were invited to evaluate the effectiveness of the university’s communication
and suggest possible improvements to better support university choice.
