# Appendix C – Quantitative Results

## Purpose of this appendix
This appendix documents the quantitative outputs of the study
*High School Students and University Choice*.

The aim is to provide transparent access to the empirical results
that support the findings discussed in the main project section,
without replicating the full analytical report within the portfolio.

## Methodological note
- Sample size: very small and non-representative  
- Data collection: self-administered paper questionnaire  
- Type of analysis: descriptive and exploratory  

Results should therefore be interpreted as illustrative rather than inferential.

## Language note
The quantitative outputs provided in the attached PDF are reported
in Italian, as the original study was conducted in an Italian context
and administered to Italian-speaking participants.

All variables, analytical dimensions, and interpretations are
summarized and discussed in English in the main project section.
The Italian-language outputs are included for transparency and
methodological documentation.
